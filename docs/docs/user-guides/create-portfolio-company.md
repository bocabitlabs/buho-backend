# Creating your first portfolio and company

The first thing to do is to create your first portfolio and add your first company to it.

To do that, just go to to home and click the "Add portfolio" to display the portfolio details form.

<p align="center">
<img src={require('./assets/screenshots/0.100.6/add-portfolio.png').default} alt="Buho Stocks add portfolio"/>
</p>

Once the portfolio is created, you can select it to view its details.

<p align="center">
<img src={require('./assets/screenshots/0.100.6/first-portfolio.png').default} alt="Buho Stocks portfolio list"/>
</p>

Once you are on the portfolio details page, you can add your first company from there.

<p align="center">
<img src={require('./assets/screenshots/0.100.6/portfolio-details.png').default} alt="Portfolio details"/>
</p>

Once added, it should appear on the companies list.
