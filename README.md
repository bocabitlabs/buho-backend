## üîß Install

### 0. Requirements

- Docker

### 1. Configuring the volumes

Before starting, keep in mind that the application uses 2 volumes to persist the config and the uploads. Create a volume for each of these folders and map them to the following locations.

- `/usr/src/app/config`: Folder with the configuration files (application and DB)
- `/usr/src/media`: Folder for the uploads

### 2. Chosing a Database

- `sqlite`: Default configuration.
- `mysql`: Best configuration to prevent data loss. You will need to create the database manually and them point the configuration files to it.

### 3. Update the config files and put them in the volumes

- `backend/config/config.sample.py` -> `/usr/src/app/config/config.py`
- `backend/config/mysql.conf` -> `/usr/src/app/config/mysql.conf`
